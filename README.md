## Ecosystem

[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/) is a react-powered static site
generator. It renders each file in pages as a route, and uses graphql to
fetch data from a variety of sources, for example site metadata, blog
entries in markdown, or a directory of images.

[Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) is a css-in-js library (see
mxstbr's article below). It works with string or object-based css in
components, turning those into styles and referring to them via classes.
Since emotion is generating classes for styles, components need to make
sure to pass through props.className

[Styled-system](https://jxnblk.com/styled-system/) is a way of mapping
props to a design system. The system is described in a theme object, then
properties are converted to styles, for example `mx={2}` looks up the third
element in `theme.space` so the element gets `margin-left` and
`margin-right` from a site-wide spacing scale.

[Rebass v3](https://rebassjs.org/getting-started) is a set of eight
foundational components built with styled-system: Box, Flex, Text, Heading,
Button, Link, Image, and Card. Our site components are based on these, but
Rebass is also a [great reference](https://github.com/rebassjs/rebass/blob/master/src/index.js)
for how to work with styled-system in general.

[Typography.js](https://kyleamathews.github.io/typography.js/) is a JS lib
that takes a base font size and line height, and generates a typographical
theme from them. Under the hood, it depends on [Compass Vertical
Rhythm](http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/typography/vertical_rhythm/).
Fully envisioned, typography.js generates a blob of CSS that implements an
entire theme. We’re not using the CSS blob generated by typography.js, but
we’re still using its `rhythm` function in our styled-system theme.
